# Solidity Docs Subcurrency example implementation

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#subcurrency-example

Used ganache-cli for local Ethereum test network/environment. Used the truffle suite for deploying.

Implemented the subcurrency ERC20-like token example that is contained on the solidity docs.
Shows the basic of how a token would be created - a contract that contains the balances of the token for addresses.
